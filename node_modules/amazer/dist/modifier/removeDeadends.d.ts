 * Beware that using this modifier on an unmodified area generated by the built-in

 * deadends.
 *
 * It is possible that less than the targeted amount of deadends removed, if no further
 * deadends exist.
 *
 * Example (removing 30% of the deadends):
 * ```
 * ┏━━━━━━━━━━━┓    ┏━━━━━━━━━━━┓
 * ┃       #   ┃    ┃ # # # #   ┃
 * ┃ # #   #   ┃    ┃ # # # #   ┃
