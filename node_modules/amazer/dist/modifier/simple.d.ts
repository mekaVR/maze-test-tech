 * This modifier has no separate config.
 *
 * Edges that already are solid (only consist of wall tiles) are skipped.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 *                 ┏━━━━━━━━━━━┓
 * ┏━━━━━━━━━┓     ┃ # # # # # ┃
 * ┃       # ┃     ┃ #       # ┃
 * ┃ # #   # ┃  => ┃ # # #   # ┃
 * ┃       # ┃     ┃ #       # ┃
 * ┃ # # # # ┃     ┃ # # # # # ┃
 * ┗━━━━━━━━━┛     ┗━━━━━━━━━━━┛
 * ```
 *
 * @returns A new {@link Area} instance that is completely surrounded
 *      by wall tiles.
